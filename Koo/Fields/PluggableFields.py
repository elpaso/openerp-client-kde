# @brief The PluggableFields class specializes in scanning for available
# widgets and delegates.
#
# To add a new widget or delegate, simply create a new directory and put a
# __terp__.py file that looks like this:
#
# [
# 	{ 'name': 'char', 'type': 'widget', 'class': 'WidgetClass' }
# ]
#
# Use 'delegate' for Delegates.
# Each directory can handle as many widgets and delegates as you may need.
